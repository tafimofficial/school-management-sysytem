Conclusion
This comprehensive documentation outlines a professional School Management System built with Django following the Model-View-Template architecture. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible, covering all aspects of school administration from student admission to alumni management.

The implementation should follow Django best practices, including:

Proper app organization (one app per module)

Reusable components and mixins

Comprehensive testing

Security-first approach

Performance optimization

Clean, maintainable code

The system can be developed incrementally, starting with core modules (Student, Attendance, Academics) and progressively adding more advanced features based on school requirements and feedback.
